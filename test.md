product_long_desc: |-
    The STM32 Sensor board is a 96Boards mezzanine board based around the STM32F446 MCU (named B-F446E-96B01A).
    This board enables users to prototype systems that are aware of their environment, thanks to the embedded sensors for movement,
    pressure and sound. It can be plugged directly on top of 96Boards consumer edition (CE) products and supports multiple expansion
    possibilities through the Arduino™ Uno Revision 3 and Grove™connectivity. The integrated ST-Link debugger facilitates software development,
    drag-and-drop programming and provides direct access to the ARM mbed on-line resources.
